# lyra
A small programming language

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kengorab/lyra.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kengorab/lyra)

Right now, in _very_ early stages (just writing the lexer, to be honest). But I plan on having typechecking and
compilation to bytecode, which will be interpreted by a VM that'll also be part of this project.
